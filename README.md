# Food-menu
Hello everyone, welcome to my GitHub!

I created this mini-project during a hackathon, and it showcases a simple yet interactive restaurant food menu. The entire project is built using only JavaScript (JS).

# Project Overview
This food menu application simulates a restaurant ordering system. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

• Meal Selection: Upon launching the application, users are prompted to choose the type of meal they would like to have. The available meal options are displayed for the users to select from.

• Menu Display: Once a meal type is selected, the menu items corresponding to that meal are shown. This allows users to browse through the food options available in the restaurant.

• Order Confirmation: After choosing their desired meal, users are presented with payment options. They can choose to pay either online or offline. The application then confirms their order, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

# Technologies Used
• JavaScript: The entire functionality and interactivity of the application are powered by JavaScript.
